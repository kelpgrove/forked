# Penguins 

## {#how?}
How do they work?

Penguins? Just how? 

They just never seem to stop. 

You see them just moving with such grace 

Would you like to stop one and ask? 

[yes](#stopped)
[no](#how?)



## {#stopped}
not like that

Oh god not like that not at all like that 

Rewind? 
[yes](#Rewind)




## {#Rewind}
the horror 

As you approach a penguin to slow one down, your eyes lock 

A tear pools in their eye

your faces are but an inch apart

[its all red](#mistake)

## {#mistake}
it was all a mistake

as you stand there wiping the red from your vision 

as it leaves your eyes it remains upon your hands 

stained 

[look up](#finale)


## {#finale}
As your graze finally looks beyond your stained hands 

the penguin that was just moments ago next to your face is no where to be seen 

just the once white snow drenched in red

penguins can never stop
