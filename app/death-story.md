# Death Story

## Doctor's Office {#doctor}

The doctor's office has a splendid view of the mountain. You've always dreamed about getting to that peak some day. Maybe you will, one day, when you have time.

Silhouetted against the window, the doctor's features are unreadable.

The doctor says "I'm afraid I have some very bad news. You have 30 seconds left to live. 

"By the time I finish talking, you will have 20 seconds left so, sorry about that. 

"By clicking the button below, you accept that the hospital is not responsible."

## International Airport {#airport_jump}
You are waiting at the International Airport for any plane that can take you straight up in the air. It's so exciting to think about skydiving back to earth. But the wait is very long. And boring.

Time passes.

You sit and look at your phone.

## The First Bank You Could Find {#bank}
You are at the first bank you could find.

The teller glances up at you and back down at the huge pile of green paper on their desk.

"Give me all your money!" you shout.

The teller looks up again but this time without lifting their head.

"Why?" they ask.

"Oh, good point", you reply.

## Restaurant Tr√®s Cher {#restaurant}
You were lucky to get a table at the swankiest, most avant garde restaurant in town.

A snooty waiter approaches.

The waiter asks, "May I ask how you will be paying today?"

"Oh, good point", you reply.

## Casino {#casino}
You walk into the casino feeling lucky.

A croupier beckons you over to the roulette table.

"Do you have any money?" they ask. You shake your head.

"If you don't have any money, I recommend that you get some money. And then you bring the money here. And then you gamble all that money on the roulette wheel. And then you do it again until you have no money. It's a LOT of fun."

## Mount Charlie {#mountain}

In front of you stands the impressive Mount Charlie. This mountain is your destiny. You have wanted to reach its summit since you were old enough to have pointless ambitions.

But you never had the the time. You still don't, but you're going to try it anyway.

You find a hand-hold. Then you find a foot-hold. Then you find a second hand-hold. Then you realise you're holding your own hand.

Oh boy, this is tiring. You find a nice comfortable spot to sit down.

## Illegal Cage Fighting Venue {#cage}

It's not easy to find an illegal cage fighting venue at short notice, but you managed it.

The referee is speaking.

"In the red corner! The world champion of illegal cage fighting! The Masked Lump!

"Who is brave enough! To enter this illegal cage! And fight The Masked Lump!"

You step into the cage. The referee says "I want a good! Clean! Fight! Now shake hands!".

[Fight a Good Clean Fight](#clean_fight)
[Fight a Low-Down Dirty Fight](#dirty_fight)

## Illegal Cage Fighting Venue {#clean_fight}
<inventory_add "trampoline">
Without stopping to shake hands, The Masked Lump kicks you in the private parts. You buckle over and drop to the ground, clutching your nether region and crying tears of pain.

"Congratulations!" the referee shouts at you. "You won second prize!"

"A trampoline!"

The trampoline fits nicely in your pocket!

## Crocodile Lake {#lake}

There must be a crocodile around here somewhere. Why else would it be called Crocodile Lake?

"Hey crocodiles!" You yell. "I'm right here! Come and get me!".

You didn't really think this plan through.

Fortunately, no crocodiles take you up on your offer.
