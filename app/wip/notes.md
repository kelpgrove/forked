I myself would probably go with super simple, slightly verbose and possibly redundant top level commands and then have a nice list of commands somewhere ðŸ˜‰

```
memo 'Name', 'Jack'
memo_content 'Name'

counter_value 'anteaters'
counter_value_as_words 'anteaters' # two, three, twelve
add_to_counter 'anteaters', 1
subtract_from_counter, 'anteaters', 2
set_counter 'anteaters', 33
reset_counter 'anteaters' # same as set_counter 'anteaters', 0

start_countdown 'bomb', 30
remaining_countdown_seconds 'bomb'
stop_countdown 'bomb'
pause_countdown 'bomb' # maybe effectively just an alias for stop_countdown
resume_countdown 'bomb'

add_to_inventory 'a bread' # makes this item "unique"
add_to_inventory 'potion', 3 # makes this item countable
remove_from_inventory 'a bread'
remove_from_inventory 'potion', 1
remove_all_from_inventory 'potion'
amount_in_inventory 'potion'
amount_in_inventory_as_words 'potion' # three potions
inventory_as_words # "a bread, and three potions"
```
